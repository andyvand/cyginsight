Required packages for building:

- gcc
- gcc-c++
- gcc-g77
- elfutils-libelf-devel
- rpm-build

In order to create the RPM, the spec file expects the following files:
- A Dyninst source distribution, containing the dyninst and scripts
  subdirectory, and any documentation files in the form of .pdf's.
- A libdwarf distribution.
- A libxml2 distribution.

The dyninst source distribution is created from a clean CVS checkout.
After pulling the dyninst and scripts modules and the documentation PDFs,
run the "maketar7.0.sh" script to create a tar file suitable for inclusion
in a source RPM.

The two tar files should be placed in the rpm build heirarchy (e.g.
/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES).

To build the RPM, issue a "rpmbuild -ba <specfile>"  This will perform three
actions.  It will:
- Install Dyninst into the system (i.e. inside /usr/bin, /usr/lib, and
/usr/include/dyninst)
- Create dyninst and dyninst-tests RPM, placing them in the rpm build 
heirarchy (/usr/src/redhat/RPMS)
- Create a Dyninst source RPM, placing it in the rpm build heirarchy
(/usr/src/redhat/SRPMS)
