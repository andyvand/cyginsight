Required packages for building the dyninst RPM:

- make
- gcc
- gcc-c++
- gcc-gfortran
- rpm-build
- elfutils-libelf-devel
- libxml2-devel >= 2.7.8
- libdwarf-devel 
- boost-devel


In order to create the RPMs, the spec file expects the following file:
- A Dyninst source distribution, containing the dyninst and scripts
  subdirectory, and any documentation files in the form of .pdf's.

The dyninst source distribution is created from a clean git checkout.
After pulling the dyninst and scripts modules and the documentation PDFs,
run the "maketar.sh" script to create a tar file suitable for inclusion
in a source RPM.

The tar file should be placed in the rpm build heirarchy (e.g.
~user_name/rpmbuild/SOURCES).

To build the RPM, issue a "rpmbuild -ba <specfile>".  This will perform two
actions.  It will:
- Create dyninst and RPMs, placing them in the rpm build heirarchy
  (~user_name/rpmbuild/RPMS/<arch>)
- Create a Dyninst source RPM, placing it in the rpm build heirarchy
  (~user_name/rpmbuild/SRPMS)
